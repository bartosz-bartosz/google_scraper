# google_scraper
Exercise project - Scrape some of google search results

Descriptions of classes and functions can be found inside the code.
The repository includes CSV files created with the program a moment before commit

To be improved:
- Ability to pass variables (pages_to_scrape; delay) as parameters
- Determining how fast we can scrape Google without getting bad response is crucial if we want to scrape more data
- Handling exceptions
- and more...

Risks & Limitations:
- Google doesn't really like being scraped
- Legality of scraping data from Google should be reviewed
- It would be hard to scrape that data on a large scale
